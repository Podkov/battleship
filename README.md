# battleship
Battleship is the game developed in contribution with Maciej Korczak (maciej-kor user).

The game itself is classic battleship player versus player game. Your objective is to destroy all of the hostile ships before
your opponent does it. All you have to do is shoot position on 10 x 10 map. If you hit hostile ship you can make second shot.
But if you miss, next move belongs to your opponent. Game ends when all 10 ships are destroyed.
